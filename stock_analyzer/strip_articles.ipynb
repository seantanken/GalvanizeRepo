G. Cooper are now available, with the first few episodes of each story free to readers via the Kindle iOS app and on Amazon.com\\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN)—Today, Amazon announced the launch of Kindle Vella, a new mobile-first, interactive reading experience for serialized stories. Available in the U.S. via the Kindle iOS app and on Amazon.com, Kindle Vella stories are published one short episode at a time, each ranging from 600 to 5,000 words—and the first three episodes of every story are free. Subsequent episodes can be unlocked using Tokens, which are available for purchase in bundles in the Kindle iOS app or on Amazon.com. Thousands of stories containing tens of thousands of episodes are available today, with new episodes being published regularly.\\nKindle Vella is a mobile-first, interactive experience with several fun features for readers, including:\\nTagging: Readers can use tags to browse for specific topics and genres to find stories.\\nFollowing: Once a reader follows a Kindle Vella story, they’ll be notified every time a new episode is released.\\nThumbs Up: Readers can leave a Thumbs Up on every episode they like.\\nFaves: Once a week, readers who have purchased Tokens will receive a Fave to award to the story they enjoyed most that week. Amazon will feature stories with the most Faves in the Kindle Vella store to help other readers discover popular stories.\\nAuthor Notes: Authors can speak directly to their readers at the end of episodes to share story insights and behind-the-scenes content.\\nSharing: It’s easy for readers to share the Kindle Vella stories they love right from their phones through Twitter, Facebook, and other social channels or via email and text with friends.\\n“We designed Kindle Vella as a mobile-first experience because we know readers are becoming more and more interested in stories that can be read quickly on their phones. At the same time, readers want the connection that you get from reading a story or author for a long period of time,” said David Naggar, vice president of Books and Kindle Content.\\n“In the three months since we opened Kindle Vella publishing for authors, it’s been great to see thousands of authors begin publishing thousands of stories, totaling tens of thousands of Kindle Vella episodes across dozens of genres and microgenres. Today we’re excited to make all these stories available to readers,” said Virginia Milner, principal product manager, Kindle Vella.\\nKindle Vella stories include new work from bestselling authors—including Audrey Carlan’s witty romance The Marriage Auction, Hugh Howey’s memoir Death and Life, and C. G. Cooper’s gripping thriller Daring Hope—as well as breakout debuts like Bard Constantine’s young adult fantasy The Pale Lord, Ryan King’s science fiction story Earth’s Exiles, and Callie Chase’s dystopia Bug.\\n“I’ve published close to 30 novels, and I’m enjoying the adventure of writing The Marriage Auction in this new format,” said #1 New York Times, USA Today, and international bestselling author Audrey Carlan. “Kindle Vella works perfectly for an author who really wants to dig into their story and characters, and give the readers something they’ve never read before.”\\n“Publishing with Kindle Vella was pretty much a no-brainer. Kindle Direct Publishing was already a game-changer for me, and I expect Kindle Vella to continue the trend,” said Bard Constantine, the emerging young adult fantasy author who wrote The Pale Lord. “I’m excited to continue writing and publishing new episodes so my readers can dive deeper and deeper into the story.”\\nKindle Vella is available in the U.S. in the Kindle iOS app and on the web at https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/.\\nFor more information about how to publish Kindle Vella stories in the U.S. using Kindle Direct Publishing, please visit kdp.com/Kindle-Vella.\\nAbout Kindle Direct Publishing\\nKindle Direct Publishing, or KDP, is a free self-publishing service that enables independent authors to reach new audiences and publish their work digitally and in paperback.

Readers and listeners can download the collection as a Kindle eBook or as an Audible audiobook, performed by Keke herself. Amazon Original Stories will publish the short story series in late Fall 2021.\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210331005151/en/\\nAmazon Teams Up with Keke Palmer to Publish New Short Story Series Based on Her Original Characters (Photo Credit: Quintin and Ron)\\nAt the age of 27, Keke is a prolific and formidable content creator, entertainer, businesswoman, and passionate voice for her generation. Keke first had the idea for her now viral characters just over five years ago, when she wanted to experiment with new types of comedy in the digital universe. She created characters on her Instagram account that tackled issues of class, race, femininity, and culture, with her signature brand of humor. Incorporating feedback from her fans and community on social media in real time, she refined each character to be reflective of her audience and the world around her.\\nKeke’s most popular character, Lady Miss Jacqueline—who has gained over 60 million views on Instagram alone—is the star of the stories in the upcoming Amazon Original Stories collection. Featuring illustrations throughout, the short, bingeable stories will take readers and listeners into the hilarious and fully realized world of her beloved characters, expanding on their backstories and building a plot that answers the most asked questions from her fans. The Audible audiobook will feature Keke playing each of the characters that she has created.\\n“What started out as an Instagram sketch, led me to one of my most beloved characters, Lady Miss Jacqueline. She’s always been larger than life—and a huge symbol of the moment when I realized I wanted to create worlds for my audience to get lost in. In effect, she was the beginning of my producing journey. The opportunity to share what makes her not only funny, but important, is exciting!” said Keke Palmer. “The team at Amazon Original Stories and I have a shared vision and what they have already been able to accomplish pushes me to bring my best and then some. I can’t wait to together share a new side of Lady Miss, her truth, and comedy with the world!”\\n“We are thrilled to team up with Keke to help expand her unique vision and unforgettable cast of characters into a broader literary universe,” said Julia Sommerfeld, publisher of Amazon Original Stories. “We like to think of Amazon Original Stories as serving as a playground for an innovator like Keke, to bring her groundbreaking characters to life in new ways and to push the boundaries of storytelling.”\\nLike all Amazon Original Stories, Keke’s new collection will be available to read and listen free to Prime members, as well as Kindle Unlimited subscribers. Readers can download each story individually to their Kindle or Kindle app, or get the whole collection with just one click. Stories are also available for non-members for $1.99, with the option to add digital audio for free.\\nJulia Sommerfeld, publisher of Amazon Original Stories, acquired exclusive worldwide English rights in digital audio and eBook formats from Lacy Lynch with Dupree/Miller & Associates.\\nwww.amazon.com/AmazonOriginalStories\\nAbout Keke Palmer\\nKeke Palmer is a multi-faceted actress, singer, songwriter, producer, and television host.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans to open its first fulfillment center in Little Rock, Arkansas. The new fulfillment center, which is anticipated to launch in 2021, will create over 1,000 new full-time jobs with industry leading pay and comprehensive benefits starting on day one.\\nThe City of Little Rock’s Board of Directors gave final approval for a sale of 80 acres at the Port of Little Rock to Amazon.com, Inc. during its meeting on April 7, 2020. This after the Little Rock Port Authority Board of Directors made a similar approval at their specially called meeting earlier that day. The acquisition gives the company exclusive control for the development of the Zeuber Road site.\\n“We’re delighted to be building out our network of operations in Little Rock, Arkansas,” said Alicia Boler Davis, Amazon’s vice president of global customer fulfillment. “We greatly appreciate the strong support from local and state leaders as we look to open our first fulfillment center and second delivery station in the state of Arkansas. We look forward to creating over a thousand jobs for the Little Rock community, with industry leading pay and comprehensive benefits starting on day one.”\\n“It’s not surprising that Amazon has selected the Port of Little Rock as the newest location for its next project,” Governor Hutchinson said. \"Arkansas has a trained workforce and is centrally located with easy access to miles of interstate, rail, and navigable waterways. I am delighted by Amazon’s decision and confident that the Port of Little Rock will be a great fit for the company.”\\nIn the new 825,000 square-foot fulfillment center, Amazon employees will work alongside Amazon robotics to pick, pack and ship small items to customers such as books, electronics and toys. The site, which is anticipated to launch in 2021, will create over 1,000 new full-time jobs.\\nAmazon is also planning a new 85,000 square-foot delivery station which is anticipated to launch in late 2020. Delivery stations power the last mile of Amazon’s order fulfillment process. Packages are transported to delivery stations from Amazon fulfillment and sortation centers, and then loaded into vehicles for delivery to customers. The delivery station will create hundreds of permanent, full-time and part-time jobs, in addition to offering entrepreneurs the opportunity to build their own small business delivering Amazon packages, and independent contractors the flexibility to be their own boss and create their own schedule delivering for Amazon Flex. To learn more, visit www.logistics.amazon.com and https://flex.amazon.com/.\\n“Little Rock welcomes Amazon in Arkansas’ first major investment from the company and is excited to provide new economic opportunities to our residents,” said Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott, Jr. “The COVID-19 public health crisis has caused deep concern among many Little Rock families as they struggle to stay afloat due to current economic uncertainty. Today’s announcement provides reassurance that Little Rock will rebound and that jobs are on the way. Additionally, Little Rock’s geographical location with river, rail, road, and air access make it ideal to expand Amazon’s distribution throughout the South.”\\n\"Central Arkansas is quickly becoming a magnet for new economic development, this is due to continued investment in our infrastructure. I\\'m proud to lead a group of committed partners whose hard work has led to one of the largest companies in the world opening a new center in Pulaski County,\" said Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde. \"Since we began planning industrial quality road and traffic infrastructure two years ago, we’ve attracted two international companies that are bringing new jobs to central Arkansas in large numbers.\"\\nOn top of Amazon’s industry-leading minimum starting wage from $15, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match starting on day one. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility with their growing families.\\nAbout Amazon: Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.
