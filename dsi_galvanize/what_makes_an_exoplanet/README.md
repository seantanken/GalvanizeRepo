What is an exoplanet? - Planet outside of our solar system

How to detect?
Radial velocity - gravity of planet orbiting star causes star to wobble as the planet travels around star
Transit - planet blocks a bit of the star as it travels across it, making the star a bit dimmer
favors larger planets

How to confirm?
Need multiple transits to confirm a regular affect, reject other objects/artifacts that might look like planets
favors faster planets - more transits/data
Need confirmation of evidence from multiple telescopes/detection methods

Current Data:

Quite a few outliers in planet size and year length
    Much larger than mean
    All are candidates
    No correlation between large planet radius and long year length
No real correlation between planet size and year length (as far as I can tell, may need to do more work)
Comparison between sampled confirmed and candidate planets show:
    ~same year length, slightly lower year length for candidate planets
    Consisitantly larger candidate planets
    Does not make much sense since larger planets with shorter year lengths would be easier to detect and confirm
