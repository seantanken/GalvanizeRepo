.DS_STORE
# CLI Sentence
Using only the `cd`, `ls` and `cp` commands (don't use finder or mkdir), copy folders from the verbs, adverbs, nouns and conjunction folders into the `sentence` directory to create a directory heirarchy that forms a sentence.

# Example
`sentence/the/zebra/joyously/dreamt/while/the/lion/secretively/leapt`

# Tips
* Use tab completion to help you narrow down what folders to copy
